## Project Details

Here's more detailed information about it:

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Analyze built-in sample datasets or upload your own CSV files
- **Interactive 3D Visualizations**: Compare original data with K-means and Hierarchical clustering results
- **Optimal Cluster Detection**: Automated determination of the optimal number of clusters using:
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Score
  - Calinski-Harabasz Method
  - Ensemble approach combining all methods  
- **Comprehensive Performance Metrics**:
  - Precision, Recall, Jaccard Index
  - Rand Index
  - Fowlkes-Mallows Score  
- **Custom Dataset Mapping**: For uploaded files, map columns to appropriate features
