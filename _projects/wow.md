## Development Workflow
### Phase 1: Database Design & Schema Creation
Objective: Design normalized relational database schema with ER-Diagram for MMORPG character data

- Created comprehensive entity-relationship diagrams using crow's feet notation
- Normalized database to 3NF to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity
- Defined relationship modalities and cardinalities for optimal performance
- Technologies: **MySQL, ER Modeling, Database Normalization**

### Phase 2: Physical Implementation & Data Layer
Objective: Build secure data access layer with proper validation and abstraction

- Implemented physical data models with appropriate primary and foreign key, and update, delete constraints
- Developed JAVA-based data access layer using JDBC with prepared statements
- Created comprehensive input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Built abstraction layers for database operations with transaction support
- Technologies: **JAVA, JDBC, Data Validation, SQL Security**

### Phase 3: ETL Pipeline & Data Integration
Objective: Build robust ETL processes for data ingestion and transformation

- Designed automated ETL pipelines to extract data from multiple game servers
- Implemented data transformation rules for standardization and quality assurance
- Created incremental loading strategies for real-time data synchronization
- Built data validation and error handling mechanisms with detailed logging
- Developed error handling and logging mechanisms for failed data loads
- Technologies: **JAVA, JDBC Batch Processing, SQL Stored Procedures, Data Validation**

### Phase 4: Query Development & Analytics
Objective: Implement complex analytics and reporting capabilities  

- Developed sophisticated SQL queries using multiple joins and aggregations
- Created stored procedures for complex business logic and performance optimization
- Built analytics engine for multi-dimensional game statistics analysis
- Implemented efficient indexing strategies for query optimization
- Technologies: **SQL, Joins & Aggregations, Views, Data Analytics, Reporting**

### Phase 5: Web Interface & Stakeholder Dashboard
Objective: Create interactive web application for data visualization and management 

- Built JSP-based web application with MVC architecture
- Implemented dynamic filtering and search capabilities
- Created interactive charts and visualizations for game statistics
- Developed role-based access control for different stakeholder views
- Technologies: **JSP, Web Development, Interactive UI, Git Version Control**
