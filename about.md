## Personal Life

Beyond the world of data and code, I enjoy exploring beautiful trails, finding tranquility and perspective on weekend hiking adventures. When indoors, I'm often immersed in books that expand my horizons—from data science literature to thought-provoking fiction. I'm also an enthusiastic League of Legends player, where strategic thinking and teamwork offer a different kind of problem-solving challenge. In my kitchen, you'll find me experimenting with baking techniques, applying the same precision and creativity that drives my professional work to create perfect pastries and breads.

My constant companion on life's adventures is my beloved dog, Wangwang Shen, who made the incredible journey with me from China to the USA. Having navigated international travel together, we now spend our days exploring neighborhoods and parks. Wangwang's curiosity and joy remind me to appreciate the simple pleasures and find wonder in our surroundings, no matter how busy life gets.
